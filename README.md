## Overview

This repository includes the captured data and spectral brdf implementations of the SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 paper **Spectral Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification via Differentiable Rendering and Null-Space Sampling**, by Mengqi (Mandy) Xia, Bai Xue, Rachel Liang, and Holly Rushmeier.

Spectral information is vital across many fields but often costly to capture. We present a method to recover spectra from multispectral images using differentiable rendering and null-space sampling. This approach quantifies uncertainty, incorporates interreflections, accelerates reconstruction, and enables spectral material authoring, offering a practical alternative to hyperspectral imaging.

## Data

The `data` directory contains the ground truth spectra of the physical Cornell box used in this paper.

`readdata.ipynb` provides the code for loading these data.

The `images` directory contains the captured photos.

The `scenes` directory contains the Mitsuba 3 scene files for rendering these physical experiments.


## Code

The `brdf` directory contains spectral BRDF implementations, using either a discrete set of values (`spectralDiffuse.py`) and a B-spline representation (`SmoothBsplineDiffuse.py`). 

The `mitsuba` folder contains the modifed `spectrum.h` and `spectrum.cpp` files for the physical experiments. In this work, we set the wavelength range to 400â€“700 nm and fitted sensitivity functions using the Macbeth chart. Please update these two files in Mitsuba 3, recompile, and set your Mitsuba path in `bspline.py` and `SpectralDiffuse.py`.
